lxffi‘rAMORPHossss 111. 3245

parodied in Mr. Housman’s Fragment of a Greek Tragedy, ‘1 go
into the house with legs and speedss‘

33. omne: poet. for totum.

34. [F]⁰r micant many editors adopt a Renaissance conjecture
vibrant.

35. Tyria de gente profecti: they had accompanied Cadmus
from Phoenicia, of which Tyre was the ancient capital.

38. caeruleus, ‘dark-blue.' The idea of the colour is trans-
serred from the waters of the cave to the dragon, but there may
be also an idea of the steel-blue hue which is to be seen on the
skin of some snakes. Euripides, Pham. 820, uses φοινικόλοφος,
⁴ purple-crested.’

40. attonitos, ‘panic-stricken, spell-bound.’ The word is used
of the paralysing effect of any strong emotion. Cf. 532.

41. squamosos orbes: orbes means the coils of the dragon‚
‘rolls his scaly folds in winding coils,' a redundant line. Cf.
Milton, Par. Lost ix. 516 :

‘ So varied he, and of his tortuous train
Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve.’

42. sinuatum: the middle use of the passive, on the analogy of
Greek, as a pure reflexive, to express an action performed by the
subject on itself. This use is common in Vergil and Ovid, and
found in Horace, Tacitus, and Pliny. Here ‘coils himself ’. Cf.
Tac. Germ. 35 ‘donec in Chattos usque sinuetur ', i.e. extends in
a curve. Cf. also Milton, Par. Lost iv. 348:

‘Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine
His braided train.’

[z'mmensos, vulgo. immenso, Plan„ Aldus]
43. erectus: the same reflexive use in the case of a participle3
ertgo is often used reflexively in the passive in post-Augustan
times. Cf. V. Aen. viii. 25 ‘iamque sub auras Erigitur ³. Cf. Par.

Lost ix, 497 sqq.:
‘But he, his flexile orbs of scaly coil
Twining, in arch enormous rears alost

His length, and with his greater bulk in air
Erect, on all the grove looks down.'—King.

44. tanto corpore: abl. of description, always used without
a preposition‚ but with an attribute. G.L. 400, n. 1.

45. spectes: present subjunctive, partly owing to the vague
future condition, ‘if one should look,' partly to the use of the
indefinite second person.

geminas qui separat Arctos. Scorpion, the eighth sign of the
zodiac, which winds its tail round the Great Bear, its middle
round the Lesser Bear, and with its drawn-back head touches the

Arctic circle.
