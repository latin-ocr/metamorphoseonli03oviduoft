8 INTRODUCTION

displeased by it, there must have been an additional reason for
the sudden infliction of a sentence of such severity. Ovid
himself always refers to the cause in mysterious terms, naming
his eyes as the offenders, and persistently deelaring that it was
an ‘ error ², not a ‘scelus' on his part. It seems likely that his
fault was to have looked on without interference at some
ofsence committed by a member of the Emperor’s family. In
this same year the younger Julia was banished for her intrigue
with Silanus, of which Ovid may have been aware. Augustus,
already prejudiced against him by his early writings, may have
held him responsible. At any rate, the sentence fell, and all
the poet's works were removed from the public libraries.

The voyage to Tomi was long and dreary‚ and probably it
was not till the spring of A.D. 9 that Ovid arrived there.
The country was bleak and desolate, the winters long and
severe, with continual snow. There were frequent attacks on
the town by the wild tribes surrounding it, and the inhabitants
were obliged to pursue their daily work armed. The people
still clung to their native tongue‚ which any foreigner found it
necessary to learn. They were slow in assimilating civilization,
and Ovid could find no congenial companions. He had
never taken any interest in warfare, and his tastes had always
been for the lighter side of life, with the brilliant social inter-
course and elegant amusements so easily found at Rome.
His spirit was crushed by the loss of all this and the cheerless
nature of his surroundings, and he spent the remaining years
of his lise in lamenting his fate and making abject appeals for
mercy to the Emperor through his wife and friends. Augustus
ignored them till his death in A.D. 14, and his successor,
Tiberius, was equally inexorable, with the result that Ovid was
left to die in exile at Tomi in A.D. 18.

The works of Ovld fall into three groups, corresponding with
the three phases of his life.

First come those written in his youth. These include
