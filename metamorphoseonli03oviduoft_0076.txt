luminis: the ablative of separation is more common than the
genitive with orbus. Cf. Lucr. v. 840 ‘ orba pedum '. G.L. 405. 2.

518. Bacchica sacra: the Bacchic mysteries, rites performed by
the frenzied worshippers of the god in his honour. Here specially
are meant the tm‘etemta orgia celebrated by the Thebans every
third year, on Mt. Cithaeron at night. Cf. V. Aen. iv. 302 ‘ubi
audito stimulant trieterica Baccho orgia nocturnusque vocat
clamore Cithaeron’.

519. quam: dies is feminine when it means a day specially
marked out or appointed.

520. novus, ‘yet unknown.' Cf. Eur. Bacch. 219 ὁ νεωστὶ δαίμων.
proles Semeleia: Bacchus was the son of Jupiter and Semele.
Liber: an ancient Italian deity who presided over the cultiva-

tion of the vine and fields‚ identified later by the Romans with
the Greek Bacchus or Dionysus. The name is probably connected
with liberare, i.e. the Deliverer. Cf. Λυαῖος.

festis ululatibus: the Bacchic rites were always accompanied
by the frenzied eries and howls of the Bacchanals, as well as by the
clashing of cymbals and beating of tambours or drums.

529. matresque nurusque, ‘mothers and daughters(-in-law).’
It is often but, it would seem, erroneously stated that the Latin
poets used nurus, ‘metri gratia,’ for feminae or mulieres. But see
Professor Hardie in the Classical Revz'ew, vol. xviii, p. 158.

530. vulgusqfffi: —que is lengthened in the accented part of a
foot (generally in the second foot but sometimes in the fifth) when
another -que follows, by Vergil usually before two consonants or
a double consonant, but Ovid is less careful. This may be an
imitation of the Greek lengthening of τε, or, as -que is thought
by some to be long sometimes in the accented parts of a Saturnian
verse, it may be an archaism. Cf. V. Ecl. iv. 51 ‘ T errasque
tractusque ', Met. i. 193 ‘ Faunique Satyrique' ; also V. Aen. ix. 767
‘ Alcandrumque Haliumque Noemonaque Prytanimque ⁹ copied by
Ovid in Asel. xiii. 258.
