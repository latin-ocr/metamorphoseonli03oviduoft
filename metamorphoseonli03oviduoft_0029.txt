THE INFLUENCE OF RHETORIC ²5

and from all losty and refined feeling. Of thern all his Ocdt'ptcs
shows these sailings most, as in the rhetorical discussion between
Creon and Oedipus upon the necessity of enduring some evils
of which the remedies are still more shamesul. All the charac-
ters are debased and salsified, and none more clearly so than
his Antigone, who reveals her character by long rhetorical
discussions, instead of, as in SophocleS, rather by actions than
by words.

The same saults of bombastic declamation, exaggeration,
and repetition are found in the works of Persius, and are
aggravated by an obscurity and vagueness of style which
make the deciphering of his meaning a work of time and
patience. This obscurity is caused chiefly by the boldness of
his figures and his unnatural combinations of words and
thoughts. The one redeeming point of his work is its moral
earnestness. He was a follower of the Stoic philosophy, and
it is the influence of that alone which curbs the emptiness
and verbosity of his style.

It is interesting and pleasant to notice here a poet who
succeeded in keeping free from the contaminating influence
of rhetoric. Phaedrus in his Fables has a style both clear and
simple and entirely free from bombastic diction. The only
other writer of whom this can be said from this time is
Petronius Arbiter, whose Cena Tre‘malcln'om's, probably written
in the time of Nero, is remarkable for its faithfulness to life,
and its simple and natural style, with no false glitter of rhetoric
or stilted harangues.

The Argonautica of Valerius Flaccus is again entirely under
the influence of rhetoric, and though showing considerable
vivacity and poetical power, is made obscure and sometimes
tedious by the complicated figures, too lengthy treatment, and
artificial diction. The same fausts, with almost nothing to
redeem them, are seen in the author of the Ilias
Latina and in Silius Italicus, who, whilst imitating Vergil
