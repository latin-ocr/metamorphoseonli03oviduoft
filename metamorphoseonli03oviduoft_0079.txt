[564—700. Cadmus, Athamas, and thc friends of Pentheus try
to overcome his opposition to the god, but in vain,· his anger is
only kindled the more by their remonstrance. His servants return,
bringing, as they think, not Bacchus but an Etrurian who has been
taking part in the rt'tes. When questioned by Pentheus, the captive
tells that his name is Acoetes, and that he is the son of a lilaeonian
fisherman, who at his death lest nothing to his son but the
knowledge of his craft and tlze sea for a fishing-ground. Through
a desire or travel he learnt the art of steering; and once, when
sailing or Delos, he landed on Chios with his comrades. In the
morning when he called upon the latter to start, they brought with
them a youth whom they had found and intended to sell into
slavery. Acoetes, though not knowing Bacchus, saw that the
youth was a god, and refused to take him on board. The others
overcame his opposition by force, and they all embarkea'. A s soon
as they had done sa, the youth appeared to rouse himself} and asked
to be landed at Naxos,· to this the sailors pretended to consent, but
when Acoetes began steering in that direction they seized the
rudder and altered the ship’s course. Perceiving this, the youth
besought them to grant his request .· when they refused, he suddenly
revealed himself as Bacchus, and, whilst ivy and vine leaves
sprang up and climbed over the ship, transformed all the crew
except Acoetes into dolphz'nS. They leapt into the sea, and Acoetes
at the god ’s biddzng steerea' the boat for Dia, where he joined at
once the Bacchic worship. (The story is told in the Homeric Hymn
to Dionysus, q. v.) To this story Pentheus listens, but still refuses
to accept the warning, and orders his servants to take Acoetes and
put him to a cruel death. But while the instruments of torture
are being prepared, the doors of his prison open, his chains fall off,
and he is set frea]
