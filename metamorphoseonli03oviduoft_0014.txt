II. THE METAMORPHOSES

In the Metamorphoses Ovid makes no pretence of working
out a single idea of wide human, or at least national interest—
thc distinguishing characteristic of the true epic. He writes
in epic metre, and observes, it is true, certain technicalities of
the epic style, such as the catalogue of names (ll. 205 sq.)
in this book, but the link which binds the stories together is
nothing greater than the introduction of a transformation of
some kind, not by any means always that of the hero of the
story. It is easily seen that the mechanical nature of such
a link gave the poet a very wide sphere of material, allowing
him to draw upon the legends and history of all nations.
Transformations had always played a great part in the legends
of various countries, and in none a greater than in those of
Greece. The very abundance of material was the greatest
difficulty before the writer. The old stories of mythology had
been taken as subjects so often by poets that for some years
before Ovid there had been a general feeling that this ground
was already exhausted, and incapable of yielding further fruit.
Ovid, however, attacked the task undismayed, and, thanks to
his wonderful gift as a raconteur‚ his rich imagination, and the
light ease of his verse, succeeded so well that his poem became
the bearer of the old myths to the Middle Ages, Nor did his
influence stop there. In spite of the revival of classical
learning, which led scholars andpoets back behind Ovid to
his great predecessors‚ the Metamorphoses has kept its hold on
the imagination of succeeding centuries even up to our own
day, and traces of its influence may still be seen in such poets
as Williarn Morris ancl Swinburne.

It is not possible to tell exactly how much Ovid owed to his
predecessors. In early Alexandrine times a poet Boios wrote
a poem Ὀρνιθογονία, under the name of a fictitious Delphic
