THE INFLUENCE OF RHETORIC 27

and by so doing osten over-reaches himself. The sting of
satire lies in its truth, and much of Juvenal's most powerful
indignation is wasted because he paints his picture in colours
too dark. However‚ in much of his later work the rhetoric
is less tawdry and the result more powersul. His training
may be seen also in his habit of definitely taking a subject for
each satire and in the regular development of the same.

During the later Empire rhetoric kept its hold upon poetry,
which was by this time little more than versified declamation.

In conclusion, the relation of rhetoric to poetry may be
summarized thus. While the life of a nation is primitive, and
its civilization rude, rhetoric is united to poetry in form and
purpose. As the national life grows from childhood to its
prime, oratory becomes a powerful and independent factor in
ι the state3 rhetoric thereby attains an existence apart from
poetry, with its own obJ'ects and methods of achieving thern.
There is still, however, ground on which its territory overlaps
that of poetry, and through this it retains a slight and legitimate
influence over the latter. After the nation’s highest power has
been reached, and it begins to decline, rhetoric oversteps its
limits, encroaching gradually more and more on the realm of
poetry, till finally the presence or absence of metrical form is
practically the only distinction between the two. It is the
victory of the false over the true, of shadow over reality‚ of
sentiment over action, which is always seen to be symptomatic
of the decline of greatness‚ whether in the history of the deeds
or of the thought of a nation.
