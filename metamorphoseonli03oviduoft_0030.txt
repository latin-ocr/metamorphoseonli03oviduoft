26 INTRODUCTION

throughout, and also Horace, Ovid, and Lucan, continues to

render every subject he touches monotonous and devoid
of life.

Statius, a writer of real poetic gift, was, however, not strong
enough to resist the prevailing influence of the time in which
he lived, and in the midst of real thought and true feeling we
find artificial maxims and false sentiment, whilst often his
meaning, valuxable in itself, is buried beneath rhetorical rnan-
nerisms. This is seen most clearly in the Thebaid, with its
descriptions of battles, military preparations‚ and declamatory
speeches, but in all his works there is the same effort to attain
elegance‚ and the same boldness of figures.

Rhetorical traits are found, but occur naturally from the
character of his poetry, in the work of Martial, and the effect of
his rhetoric is to add brilliance and point to the ready wit and
vigour of his epigrams.

In Juvenal’s work the influence of an early training in rhetoric
is definite and great. In the schools he, as every one else,
formed certain false ideas of the characters and actions of
human beings. On turning from the practice of rhetoric to
the study of lise, instead of throwing these false impressions
aside and representing the world as it was, Juvenal carried
the pictures of the schools into his work, thereby spoiling
much of its truth and effect. His characters are literary types,
not living individuals. In the Prologue of 1115 work he satirizes
the schools and their training, and was probably fully alive to
the harm he had received. For all that, he was powerless
to escape the effects, and possibly the original opposition of
his own style to that cultivated in the schools made these
effects the more disastrous. He became diffuse where he
should have been brief ,- where some description or explana-
tion needed drawing out‚ he obscured his meaning by artificial
brevity. One of his most patent faults is exaggeration. He
paints the vices of Rome in the most glaring colours possible,
