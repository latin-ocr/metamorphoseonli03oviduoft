METAMORPHOSES ΙΙΙ. 721—733

721. quis Actaeon: sc. sit.

722. Inoo: adjective.

723. tendat: final.

724. dereptis . . . membris: [deiectis is the reading of most of
the MSS„ dereptis being Housman's conjecture. Plan. τῶν ἀφαιρε-
θέντων μελῶν.]

725. visis: sc. vulneribus.

726. iactavit: the Maenads are frequently represented in art
in this attitude, i.e. with the head thrown back and the hair
streaming on the wind. It was a typical gesture of the Bacchic
frenzy.

727. avulsum eaput . . . complexa : for avellit et complectitur.

In the Bacchae, by a daring stroke of tragic irony, Euripides
represents Agaue on her home-coming ‘ with her own son's bleeding
head in her hand, as asking where he is that he may nail her trophy
(his own head) to the palace-front' (Sidgwick‚ ad loc.). This was
the scene which (according to tradition) was played at a marriage-
revel at the Parthian court after Carrhae,—the head of Crassus
representing that of Pentheus (Mommsen iv, 337).

p These two lines take up again the tale of the beginning of the
Bacchic worship in Greece, and thus form a link to connect the
stories of the following book with those already told.
