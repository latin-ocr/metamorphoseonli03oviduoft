THE METAMORPHOSES 1 r

poetess‚ in which he described the origin of various birds from
men. In the Alexandrine period Nicander of Colophon—the
second century 13.c.—-wrote five books of Transsormations,
Ἐτεροιούμειια, in hexameters. They are not extant, but
Antoninus Liberalis, who was a contemporary of Nicander,
tells the story of them. Another Greek poet who dealt with
the subject was Parthenios of Nicaea, the writer of a poem
called Metamorphoses, who lived in Rome during the first
century 13.c., and had considerable influence in literary circles.
It is probable that Ovid owed something to both the last named
writers, though, as their works do not seem to have possessed
any great merit, possibly very little. Indebtedness to the
great Greeks, especially Homer and Euripides, he could not
escape. But even in the stories they had handled the
originality of Ovid's treatment is striking. For instance, in
this book we have the story of Pentheus, which forms the
subject of the Bacchae of Euripides. The story told by Acoetes
of the deecit practised upon Bacchus by the Tyrrhenian
sailors‚ and their consequent transformation into dolphins‚ has
no place in the play of Euripides. It is told also in the Fables
os Hyginus 5 and both Hyginus and Ovid probably drew upon
the Homeris Hymn to Dionysus which contains it. In Euripides
Pentheus sets out for Cithaeron with Dionysus as his guide,
and is disguised as a woman, intending to spy upon the
Bacchanals. His death is reported by a messenger, and again
Ovid differs in various details 3 for instance, Agave in her
Bacchic frenzy thinks her son a wild boar, whereas, in Euripides,
she believes it is a lion she has killed. In Euripides, too, the
Bacchanals are summoned to the spot where Pentheus lies hid
by a call from Dionysus, who, in Ovid, does not appear
personally in the death—scene. The changes Ovid makes, it
need hardly be said, are not always improvements, but they
give the novelty necessary for winning the interest of his
audience, and stamp his work with a character of its own.
