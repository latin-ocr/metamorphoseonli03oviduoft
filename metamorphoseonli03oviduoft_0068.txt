METAMORPHOSES ΙΙΙ. 228—252

s 228. per quae fuerat loca secutus: order—per loca per quae
uerat seculus.

234. tardius exierant: exire is the word used of the horses
in the chariot-races of the Circus, when they start from the
carceres.

235. anticipata Via est = ἐπιτομωτέρα γέγονεν ἡ ὁδός. Plan.
[For anticipata many MSS. read praeczpitata, which is perhaps
more Ovidian, and was adopted by the editor of the Aldine. But
praestat difficilior lectio]

238. etsi non hominis, ‘ though not mortal.’ Hominis, posses-
sive genitive. Cf. ii. 667 ‘nec equae sonus ille videtur‘.

quem non tamen = talem tamen quem non.

239. [habet is weak. agit might be conjectured =‘utters ’. See
L. and S. s.v. D. A. S.]

Circumstances.

241. sua: his own, before his transformation robbed him of thern.

242. solitis, ‘wonted.' Cf. 173 n.

[hortatibus. All the MSS. but one give latratibus (ὑλακαῖς,
Plan.)‚ which Heinsius kept and interpreted to mean that the
huntsmen imitated the bark of the hounds: while Merkel (Quaest-
Criticae, 1835) proposed—from a gloss in the codex Zwit. ‘canis
cum cane cognatas habet voces’—sociis latratibus, as a phrase
descriptive of the pack. The codex Hauniensis has the varia
lectio ‘clamoribus ⁹. D. A. S.]

oculos iam morte gravatos Pyramus erexit '.

nec cu ere ’.

crilatae: offerri is used of something found unexpectedly.

247.ve11et;: potential subjunctive. Cf. 188. Here Ovid with
his fatal fondness for ‘ conceits' cannot resist lingering over the
irony of Actaeon’s position.

249. circumstant: subject canes to be supplied from canum in
the preceding line.

in cor-pore ε poetical for in corpus.

251—2. [These two lines (found in all MSS. and in Plan.) are
possibly an interpolation (Heinsius), and as such are rejected by
some editors. They are a weak ending to a vivid narrative, but
Ovid does not always escape this fault] As they stand, notice the
rhyming of the half-lines finita . . . vita, pharetratae . . . Dianae.
This is sometimes, but not often, found in Ovid. Cf. vi. 247.

[351-510. Eclzo sees and falls in love with Mzrcz‘ssus. She
follows him, but as soon as slze draws near lte flees, and, thus

scorned, slze hides in the woods till sadz‘ng away wz‘tlz grief ske
