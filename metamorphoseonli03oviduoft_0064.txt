Canis aestifer arva '.

155. acuta densa cupressu: cf. Her. v. 137 ‘pinu praecinctus
acut‘i'. This use is an extension of the ablative of instrument, with
also an idea of r.espect Cf. 1. 20 ‘speciosam cornibus altis', also

162. margine gramineo patulos succinctus hiatus, ‘its wide
basin surrounded with a grassy marge.' Succinctus is used here in
a middle sense, cf. 42, 43 n., but differs from erectus, l. 43, in that it
takes an accusative, hiatus. It is a very common construction
in the Latin poets, and was used by them on the analogy of the
double use of the participle in Greek, eg. κεκρεμασμένος τοὺς πόδας
and κεκρεμασμείὀς τὴν ἀσπίδα, ‘hung up by the feet' and ‘having
hung up one's shield ’. 111 501116 instances the participle is practi-
cally active in meaning, cf. V. Aen. xi. 507 ‘oculos in virgine
fixus ², in others it is passive with an accusative of respect, cf. Aen.
iii. 47 ‘mentem formidine pressus ', and in others, as in the present
instance, there is neither special active nor reflexive meaning,
cf. Met. xi. 368 ‘rubra suffusus lumina flamma’, and the accusative
is merely retained with the passive form.

The spring rose in the cave, and formed a basin with a grassy
margin in the floor of the cave.

vincula plantae Pallade '.

pedibus: ablative of separation, cf. xiv. 689 ‘fetus arbore
dem tos ⁹.
