ME'rAMORPHOSES 111. 119-130

119. iaculo eadit eminus: contractcd for iaculo eminus ictus
cadim iaculo, ablative of instrument.

120. longius: temporal =di1tlius. Cf. Caesar, B. G. iv. 1. 7
‘longius anno remanere '. Seldom found in this sense, except in the
poets3 and even they rarely‚ if ever, use longe sor diu.

121. modo: with acceperat, ‘ which he had but just breathed '.

122. exemplo pari = eodem modo. Cf. Plautus, lx'udens ii. 3. 40
‘iactatae exemplis plurimis miserae perpetuam noctem’, and see
Lewis and Short‚ s.V. 11. c. [The rarity of this use of exemplum
led me formerly to conjecture ‘exemploque paris furit omnis turba ’‚
an easy emendation (slost besor-es) which would certainly give us
a simplet Latin sentence. Par, ‘ a pair of combatants,’ would
eonvey a very natural and perfectly Ovidian allusion to the gladia-
torial games; cf. for the adjective in this sense Lucan's ‘veluti
fatalis harenae Muneribus . . . odere pares' (iv. 708-10); and the
antithesis between par and turba would be apt enough. But
there is no real reason to suspect the MS. reading. D. A. S.]

suo Marte, ‘in combat with each other.’ The poets frequently
use the name of a god to denote his special gift or attribute. Cr.
437 ⁶ Cereris ¹. This figure of speech is called metonymy.

123. subiti, ‘newly born! Ovid often uses this word of a sudden
growth or change. Cf. v. 560 ‘et artus Vidistis vestros subitis
flavescere pennis '.

124. brevis: transferred from spatium to vilae.

125. matrem : the earth, from which they had sprung.

126. quinque superstitibus z ablative of attendant circumstances
or ablative absolute. The want of a present participle of the verb
sum is clearly felt in cases like this.

The legend is probably aetiologica1‚ i.e. it was suggested by the
word §Par-ti, the name of the ancient inhabitants of that region.
The number of survivors was fixed at five, because later that was
the number of the chief Theban families.

Echion afterwards became the son-in—law of Cadmus, by
marrying his daughter Agave.

127. Tritonidis: Pallas, who, according to one account, was
born on Lake Triton in Libya.

128. que . . . que. Cf· 7 n.

129. operis comites: cf. 147 ‘participes operum'. The genitive
is objective.

Sidonius hospes z Cadmus. Sidon was, before Tyre, the chief
city of Phoenicia.

1303 iussam: cf. 105 n.‚ also i. 399 ‘et iussos lapides sua post
vestigia mittunt ’.

sortibus, ‘oracle.' The oracular reply was often written on
a small tablet.

According to legend, it was the citadel only of Thebes which
Cadmus built, the walls and town being built later by Amphion and
