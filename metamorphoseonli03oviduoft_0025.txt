THE INFLUENCE OF RHETORIC 21

influence on succecding pocts he helped to speed poetry on
the downward path of rhetoric. He is frequently quoted by
Quintilian, which alone shows his influence in the schools at
that time. The effects of his rhetorical training are seen
clearly in the Heroides, the love—letters of legendary hcroines,
which are rhetorical throughout, in their endeavour to make
their appeal as powersul as may be. But in the Aletamorpleoses
also, and in no book more than the third, the faults due to this
influence are many. It is clearly visible in the speeches or
soliloquies put into the mouths of characters who are labouring
under great emotion, in which, instead of giving vent to their
feelings, they spend their time in analysing and describing
those feelings to the onlooker, an action entirely inconsistent
with and disproved by lise. Moreover, they do not even
describe those feelings in simple language, but pause to adorn
it with airy conceits, metaphors, paradoxes, and telling contrasts.
The speech of Narcissus in Book iii is perhaps the most
striking example of this, and the result is the estrangement of
our sympathy from the victim of an emotion which appears so
little painful. The harangue of Pentheus to his people later
in the book is again full of rhetorical devices‚ especially
antithesis, but, on the other hand, is much more natural and
full of power, and bears out rather the good than the
bad influence of rhetoric, in the strong arguments and the
forcible arrangement of them. The same good influence may
also be seen in the appeal of Phoebus to Phaethon in Book ii.
But on the whole the bad influence predominates. Other
instances of speeches belying nature occur. Inachus,¹ upon
discovering Io transformed into a heifer, is able in the midst
of his grief to dwell upon the contrast between her present
state and her past, and to point out that she can now only answer
him by lowing. Worse than this is the case of Hercules,² who,
