18 INTRODUCTION

second century 13.C. By degrees schools of rhetoric were
established, and it became the regular custom for young men
to attend thern on leaving the ludus litterarum. Thus both
poets and orators received exactly the same educati0n‚ the
object of which was oratory‚ not poetry. It was when the
schools of rhetoric degenerated into schools of declamation,
through the stifiing of free speech under the Empire, that
poetry began to suffer from the affectations and artificiality
which finally made it little more than rhetoric in verse.

Roman tragedy was always to a great extent rhetorical, full
of stately declamations, figures of speech, and moral maxims.
Of the early tragedians Accius, 170—86 B.c., shows this influence
most clearly. ‘Aiunt Accium interrogatum, cur causas non
ageret, cum apud eum in tragoediis tanta vis esset optime
respondendi, hanc reddidisse rationem, quod illic ea diceret
quae ipse vellet, in soro dicturi adversarii essent quae minime
vellet.' ¹ Of the late tragedy Seneca is the chief writer, and
we shall see that his works are rhetoric rather than poetry.

During the years 150—40 Bc. Rome was fully occupied with
military and political affairs. Therefore oratory was of the
greatest importance and practical use, and for this reason
reached its highest point of achievement at this time. The
Asiatic school of oratory‚ which made display its main obJect,
and was characterized by diffuseness and bombast, though
pruned of its faults and used brilliantly by Cicero, was adopted
by his successors with bad results, just as the successors of
Vergil and Horace may be said to have adopted as their model
the Alexandrine type of poetry, with its remoteness from life
and cumbrous learning. But during Cicero’s lifetime (and even
later) eloquence was at its best, and, side by side with it, poetry
in the hands of Lucretius, Catullus, Vergil, and Horace, showed
no signs of any evil effects from the influence of the former.
