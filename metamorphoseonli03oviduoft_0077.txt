METAMORPHOSES 111. 530-540

ignota: cf. novus, 520.
feruntur: middle. Cf. 80 n.

531. quis fin-01· ε quis, interrogative, is generally substantival‚ but
is occasionally found as a masculine adjective as here and in 632.
In some cases the following substantive can be explained as in
apposnion.

anguigenas, proles Mavortia: cs. 32, 105. Gk. Σπαρτοί.

532. attonuit: from altono, ‘thunder at,' hence ‘stupefy’.
A verb very rarely used except in the past participle attonitus.
Ovid uses attonuere, Her. iv. 5ο.

aera aere repulsa: cymbals were used in the worship of
Bacchus as in that of the Phrygian Cybele in addition to the
Phrygian pipe, tibia, and kettledrum, tympanum. There was much
in common between the worship of the two deities.

533. adunco tibia cornu: the Phrygian pipe, curved and with
a horn end which increased the sound. For the same terms used
of the worship of Cybele cf. Catullus lxiii. 20, and of Bacchus,
lxiv. 261: ‘Plangebant alii proceris tympana palmis,

aut tereti tenues tinnitus aere ciebant,
multis raucisonos efflabant cornua bombos
barbaraque horribili stridebat tibia cantu?

534. magicae fraudes: the rites which were performed by night
and purposely surrounded with mystery‚ naturally conveyed the idea
ofmagic to the minds of the uninitiated. Cf. Eur. Bacch. 233, where
Pentheus refers to Bacchus as ξένος, γόης, ἐπῳδός. Cf. the chapters
in Livy (xxxix. 8—18) on the Bacchanalian orgies at Rome-‘ one of
the most interesting episodes in his history’ (Wordsworth).

535. tuba: a straight horn, used in the Roman army, so here, of
mythical times, an anachronism.

terruerit: subjunctive because dependent on the subjunctive
vincant. G.L. 629.
537. inania tympana, ‘the hollow drums.’
vineant: consecutive.
538. mirer: deliberative.
longa per aequora: over the sea from Phoenicia. This is
inconsistent with ll. 46 sqq. where Ovid relates the killing of all the
cptcrliradtles of Cadmus by the dragon, but the poet is often careless
o eta1 .

539. Tyron: the capital of Phoenicia, which they had left, to

build a new Tyre in Thebes.

profugos Penates, ‘your exiled household gods.' The
Penates were the guardian deities of a Roman's house, originally
gods of the store (= penus), the word coming from the same root
as pasco, pabulum. Cf. V. Aen. i. 68 ‘Ilium in Italiam portans
victosque Penates ’. The establishment of the Penates was a sure
token of the settlement of a new state οι· colony.

540. sine Marte, ‘ without a struggle.’ Cf. 123 n.

capi: subjects, Tyron ac Penates.
