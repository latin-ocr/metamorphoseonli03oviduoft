M ETAMORPHOSES 111. 468—48 1

468. votum: explained by the end of the line, ‘vellem, quod
amamus, abesset!

m¹.‘i,¹¹ the case of! Cf. V. Aen. ii. 540 ‘Achilles talis in
ὴοεῐίἓῦῒοᾶι : potential. abesset, optative, dependent on vellem.

470. superant = supersunt.

471. posituro: Livy is the first to use the future participle as
equivalent to an adjectival clause, but after this time the usage
becomes more common. G.L. 438 n. Here posituro is practically
eqpifv'alent to a causal clause, ‘for in death I shall lay down my

473. moriemur in una. : for the same ending cf. ii. 609.

Throughout the last ten lines of this speech of Narcissus,
one cannot help feeling that he is realizing and indeed enjoying
the strangeness of his fate and the mental exercise of analysing
the complicated relation between himself and his reflection. The
result is such an unreal atmosphere that his death comes at last
as a shock, so impossible is it to believe that such a fantastically
minded lover could really die of grief. That Ovid intended it to be
moek·sentiment is probable. In his age, no less than in modern
times, society considered it a crime to indulge in, or at any rate to
reveal to an audience, any deep feeling. In Rz'clzara’ II, Shakespeare
makes the king ask Gaunt the very question which comes to the
rnind as one listens to Narcissus, ‘ Can sick men play so nicely
with their names ? ’ The answer Gaunt gives is, ‘ N 0, misery makes
sport to mock itself‚’ an answer borne out by the underlying bitter-
ness in his Jests, which does not, however, exist in the words of
Narcissus.

474. ad faeiem . . . eandem: for at the beginning of his speech
he had half risen and turned to the woods, and though during it
he had apostrophized his image in the water, he only now returned
to the fixed contemplation of it.

male sanus, ‘distraught' ; male here is almost a negative.
Cf. V. Aen. iv. 8 ‘adloquitur male sana sororem ’.

478. quod tangere non est: a Greek construction. est=
it is possible. Cf. Greek ἔστι for πάρεστι with infinitive Hom. Il.
xx. 246 ἔστι γὰρ ἀμφοτέροισιν ὀνείδεα μυθήσασθαι. The use {S more
common with a negative, cf. Il. vi. 267.

479. alimenta, ‘food,' used only in the plural by the
oets.
p 480. summa ab ora, ‘tore down the garment from its upper
edge.’ [Most of the codices read ‘summo vestem deduxit ab
ore ’. The arguments in favour of the emendation are that summo
ore is untranslatable, and that the same line with summa ora recurs
in v. 398, with the verb laniarat for deduxit]

481. marmoreis, ‘ white as marble.’ Cf. l. 419.
