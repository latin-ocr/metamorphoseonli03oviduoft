PREFACE

IN the text of this edition I have followed M, the ‘Marcian'
MS. (the readings of which are available through the editions
of Riese and Korn), as closely as possible, but as the book is
not intended for professional scholars, Ι have not thought it
necessary to mention every point of detail in which I have
left it in favour of the readings of other MSS. or of a generally
accepted conjecture3 other divergences‚ when they occur, are
noted, all textual comment being included in square brackets.
I have cited the translation of Planudes where his evidence
seemed likely to be of service. One hundred and twenty lines
have been cut out as unsuited for school reading.

For the Notes, in addition to Ehwald's revision of the Haupt
and Miiller edition, I have derived much help from the edition
of H. Magnus (1892) and have also read Lemaire. As my
experience is that students will not take the trouble to look up
references, even when they possess the necessary books, as is
not always the case, I have intentionally dealt as fully as possible
with anything that has seemed likely to cause difficulty.

1 gratefully acknowledge the great help given me by Professor
Slater of Cardiff. He has looked over the whole, and I arn
indebted to him for numerous corrections, suggestions, and
references. I have in the notes added his initials to the textual
emendations he has suggested, but these give no idea of all
that the book owes to him.
