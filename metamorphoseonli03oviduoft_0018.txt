14 INTRODUCTION

Book IV, where Atlas is transformed into a mountain, his
heard and hair become woods, his shoulders and arms ridges,
his head the peak of the mountain, and his bones rock. Not
only the physical, but also the mental attributes of the victims
are changed, as, in this book, Actaeon is given the timidity,
as well as the speed, of a stag.

Thougli Ovid's poetry is practically without moral feeling,
and contains no depth of passion, he must be granted the
possession of shrewd insight into the lighter affections and
emotions of human beings. His gods and goddesses are
generally less worthy of admiration than his human characters,
and their actions are dictated by selfishnessâ€š jealousy, or the
desire of revenge. His men and women we find actuated by

Perseus by knight-errantry, Philemon and Baucis by hospitality,
Ceyx and Alcyone by faithful love.

cannot stop here. It is a common belief that every virtue
carries with it a corresponding vice, and in no case do faults
resulting from good qualities stand out more clearly than in
the poetry of Ovid. To begin with, his fertile fancy and
readiness of expression lead him into the pitfall of needless
and sometimes even repulsive repetition. He often repeats
lines or half-lines which have caught his fancy, e. g. III, ll. 23
and 502, and even more than that, draws out a description or
an idea long after the point has been reached. Thus in this
book he cannot cease emphasizing the strangeness of a situation
in which both lover and loved are one, cf. ll. 425 sqq. Nar-
cissus indeed alienates our sympathy by the evident interest
he takes in the analysis of his own novel feelings and position.
