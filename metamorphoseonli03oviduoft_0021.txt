THE INFLUENCE OF RHETORIC 17

then it retains many of the characteristics of poetry. This is only
natural, as the objects of oratory and poetry are to some extent
the same. The aim of the poet, as of the orator, is ‘ to teach,
to charm, to move ¹—d0cet‚ delectat, adficit—and to achieve
this, certain methods of arranging words and thoughts are
legitimately practised in order to give variety and emphasis.

It is obvious that, as oratory must always play a part in
human life, poetry, of which the aim is to represent that life
truly and pleasingly‚ must show the influence of the rules of
the art in at least all scenes which portray public speaking or
impassioned private pleading. It is only when rhetoric, the
science as opposed to the practice of eloquence‚ begins to
outweigh and thrust aside oratory, that this inevitable influence
on poetry becomes noticeable through the faults it produces.
As long as the object of public speaking is some definite
practical result, rhetoric keeps its place as the servant both of
the orator and of the poet, enabling them to attain the effect
desired in the best way. Thus certain characteristics of rhetoric
are found even in the best poetry 3 for instance, a careful and
deliberate arrangement and building up of arguments or of the
details of a situation in order to lead up to the point in view ;
inversion of the natural order of words or repetition, to impress
that point on the mind of the hearer or reader ς apostrophe,
exclamation, questions expecting no answer 3--the aim being
to give variety and to avoid a slackening of interest.

The Roman character and language were peculiarly fitted
for oratory, and though it was never the delight of all classes of
men, as in Greece, it became the practical object of education
and the necessary equipment of all public men. Dignsty,
power, and logical precision were the main features of the
Roman character, and therefore of the Roman language, and
these are the mainsprings of oratory. The study of rhetoric
was practised at Rome in early times, and only received

a fresh impulse from the infiux of Greek rhetoricians in the
