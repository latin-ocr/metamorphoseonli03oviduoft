12 INTRODUCTION

This, t00‚ is enriched by a countless store of similes. Itis
hardly possible to turn a page of the poem without finding
some apt simile or metaphor‚ expressed in vivid and graceful
language, and often showing a deep interest in and knowledge
of nature. To the training in rhetoric, which formed the chief
part of the education of Roman youth in his day, he owed,
besides the greatest of his faults, an unfailing variety of
expression, which, though leading him at times into wearisome
redundance, yet, on the whole, enabled him to escape the
monotony which sometimes descended upon the easy regularity
of his verse. For examples of this variety in the expression of
the same fact we have in this book ll. 50 and 145, both
describing the midday hour, and also the descriptions of the
two caves, that of the dragon, ll. 28 sq., and that sacred to
Diana, ll. 155 sqq. In his descriptions of nature Ovidis almost
always at his best, and his pictures are vivid both in form and
colour. He chooses to represent the Arcadian side of nature,
cool groves and caves with trickling water—it is interesting to
notice how large a part is played by water in his descriptions—
rather than her terrible side. He paints in luminous colours,
and in fact idealizes the natural world 3 but this is in accordance
with his general determination to regard nothing as serious,
and the life he describes is surrounded by the same unreal,
artificia] atmosphere.

The poet's greatest gift of all, in which he has never been
surpassed, is his power of narrative. Although‚ over and over
again, the stories he tells have the same theme, he still succeeds
in chaining the interest of his reader, and exciting his sympathy,
pity, admiration, or, at lowest, his curiosity as to the end.
For characterization he cares little3 his heroes and heroines,
gods and goddesses, are modelled on the gay dwellers in his
own world, and have but little to distinguish them from
each other. But the action of his stories is quick and
vigorous, and the versification is light, rapid‚ and equable.
