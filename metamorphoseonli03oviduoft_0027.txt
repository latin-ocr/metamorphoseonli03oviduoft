narrative and description, and the brightness and ease of his
verse, have placed him among the ranks of the great Roman
poets in the estimation of succeeding centuries.

The poets who followed Ovid unfortunately did not possess
his atoning qualities, and after his time the decline of poetry
'was rapid. This was largely due to the tyranny practised by
the Emperors¹—especially Nero and Domitian—who suppressed
all independence of thought in oratory and literature. Also
the practice of recitatio (the reading aloud by poets of their
poems to a carefully chosen audience), which was in vogue even
in Ovid’s time and which never afterwards lost favour, led still
