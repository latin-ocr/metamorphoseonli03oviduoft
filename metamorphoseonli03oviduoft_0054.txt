METAMORPHOSES 111. 5-19

5. sacto: abl. of the respect in which the adjectives jn'us and
sceleratus are applied: ‘just and unjust at once‚’ King.

6. possit: rhetorical questions which expect a potential answer
in the negative, and are themselves equivalent to a negative state-
ment, are put in the subjunctive. G.L. 466, 13. 150. Here, quis
possit? = nemo polest.

7. que . . . que, ‘both . . . and,’ found in poetry and late
prose; only once in Cicero, De Fz'n. i. 16. 51 ‘noctesque diesque ',
and there the words seem to be a quotation from Ennius, cf.
Madvig, ad loe. Cf. 128 ‘petiitque deditque '‚ where two contrasting
notions are joined.

8. Agenorides: Cadmus.

Phoebi oracula, at Delphi, as shown by l. 14. It was usual
to consult an oracle before taking out a colony or founding
a state.

oracula: poetic. plural for singular. This is a common device
of the Latin poets‚ and the reason for it is easily seen in the case
of words with a plural more convenient than the singular for pur-
poses of metre. In a hexameter no word containing the quantities
-υ- can be employed, and when the singular has these quan-
tities‚ either the word must be given up, or the plural used. From
such words the usage was easily extended to others by analogy.
ln a few cases an actual plural meaning can perhaps be traced, as
here oracula may contain the idea of ‘divine announcements’.
In i. 321 Ovid uses the syncopated form oracla.

10. solis, ‘lonely.'

11. curvi immunis aratri: the genitive instead of the ablative
with adjectives of separation begins with the Augustan poets.
G.L. 374, n. 8. Cf. iv. 5 ‘immunesque operum ⁵.

12. qua, ‘ where,' not to be taken with herba.

13. fae condas: a common periphrasis for the imperative. Cf.
Cic. Fam. xi. 3. 4 ‘ Fac cogites ‘.

14. Castalio antro: prose would require de or ex, but in
poetry the simple ablative of ⁶ place whence ⁷ is common.

The cave, situated on Mt. Parnassus, to the north of Delphi,
is represented as the seat of the oracle.

15. incustoditam : this long word of five syllables, forming two
and a half spondaic feet, represents the slow gait of the heifer. To
quote Pope, ⁶ The line too labours, and the verse moves slow.’ Cf.
ii. 684 ‘ incustoditae Pylios memorantur in agros Processisse boves '.

17. presso gressu, ‘with slow stride.’ Cf. Livy xxviii. 14. 14
‘ Hispanos presso gradu incedere iubet’.

legit vestigia, ‘follows her footsteps‚’ poetical. Cf. V. Aen.
ix. 392 ‘ et vestigia retro Observata legit '.

19. vada evaserat, ‘had left behind the fords.' Evado used
thus with the accusative of the direct object is poetical. Classical
prose would require ex and the ablative. Cf. V. Aen. vi. 425
‘ Evaditque celer ripam irremeabilis undae ⁷.
