THE METAMORPHOSES 15

Roman critics Seneca and Quintilian. The former¹ says,
‘ nescit quod bene cessit relinquere ' 3 and Quintilian² calls him
‘nimium amator ingenii sui’, and again,³ says, ‘Ovidii Medea
videtur mihi ostendere quantum ille vir praestare potuerit, si
ingenio suo imperare quam indulgere maluisset! Closely
allied to this fault is another, even more annoying to the
reader. This is Ovid’s fondness for playing on words and
turns of expression. Seneca,⁴ again, criticized this failing in
words that can never be separated from any criticism of the
poet: ‘poetarum ingeniosissimus, . . . nisi tanturn impetum
ingenii et materiae ad pueriles ineptias reduxisset! Allowance
may be made for the fact that in Rome, at all times, the habit
of punning was regarded with toleration if not with admiration,
but nevertheless, every reader of modern times, as he listens
to the soliloquy of Narcissus, is likely to agree with the follow-
ing words of Dryden in his Preface to tlte Fables.

‘Would any man, who is ready to die for love, describe his
passion like Narcissus? Would he think of “inopem me copia
fecit’', and a dozen more of such expressions, poured on the
neck os one another, and signifying all the same thing? If
this were wit, was this a time to be witty, when the poor wretch
was in the agony of death. . . . On these occasions the poet
should endeavour to raise pity, but instead of this Ovid is
tickling you with a laugh.'

For the habit of punning in moments of danger or death
we might support Ovid by the practice of no less a poet than
Shakespeare, noticeably in the death-bed scene of John of
Gaunt in Richard ΙΙ, but there the speech is not drawn out to
the same extent as in this instance of Narcissus. Both this
fault and the preceding one of redundance were due in the
main to the same cause, the preponderance given to rhetoric
in Roman education.⁵
