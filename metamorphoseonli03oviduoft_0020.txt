1 6 INTRODUCTION

Ovid’s language is chiefly remarkable for its clearness and

loved them, as is shown by the story of the three lines, chosen
respectively by his friends and himself for destruction and

the one best calculated to win and hold his listeners’ attention
and to commend his ideas to them. It is only as civilization
develops that prose becomes the vehicle of oratory‚ and even
