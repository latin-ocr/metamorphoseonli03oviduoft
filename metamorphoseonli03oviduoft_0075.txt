METAMORPHOSES 111. 506-515

the tombs of the dead. Cf. xiii. 427 of Hecuba leaving such an
offering on Hector's grave. Cf. also Hom. Od. iv. 197 :

τοῦτό νυ καὶ γε’ριις οἷον ὀϊζυροῖσι βροτοῖσι,
κείρασθαί τε κόμην βαλέειν τ’ ἀπὸ δάκρυ παρειῶν.

[pos-uere, Riese, Korn.]
508. quassas facee: quassas is either proleptic ‘brandished ',
or else simply ‘ os split or broken wood ’.
509. croceum . . . florem : croceum describes rather the centre
or heart of the flower than the whole, and this part is also meant
by medium. King translates z

‘A flower alone was all they found, whose head
Blazed golden‚ ’mid a circlet of white leaves!

foliis: the petals.
The narcissus still grows in abundance near Mt. Helicon.

[511-563. Α ltlcough tlte same (gf Tiresias z‘s greatly increased
by tlte sulfilment of his prophecy qs Narcissus’ fate, tlte seer z's still
scorned by Pentheus, son of Echion and Agaue. ln answer to his
taunts, Tiresias sorelells his death, and leis words are speedz'ly
verified. A crowd os T kebam, tlte subjects os Pentheus, ruslz past,
srenzz'ed with tlte worship qf Bacchus. The prince vainly tries
to check them, and finally sends lais servants lo capture their
leader ana’ bn'ng him bound]

511. Cognita res: concrete sor abstract, ‘knowledge of the
event.’

meritam vati . . . famam: sor Tiresias, when consulted
by Liriope as to her child's future, had replied that he would live
to be old, ⁴ si se non noverit!

For the same method of transition from one story to another,
cf. vi. 146, where the story of Arachne’s fate reaches Niobe, but is
powerless to lessen her pride.

The story of Pentheus was taken by Aeschylus as the subject
of a tragedy‚ which, however, has not come down to us. It is also
the theme of the Bacchae of Euripides. But Ovid's Pentheus is
fiercer and more ruthless than Euripides’. As there is no trans-
sormation in the story itself‚ Ovid introduces the legend of the
Tuscan mariners.

Achaidas: Greek. In Homer all Greeks are Ἀχαιοί.

513. Echionides: Pentheus, son of Echion, one of the five heroes
sprung from the dragon’s teeth. Cf. 126.

514. superum, ‘ of the gods,' genitive plural.

515. tenebras, ‘blindness,’ a poetical and rare use. Cf. Lucr-
iii. 415 ‘ occidit extemplo lumen tenebraeque sequuntur '.

lucie ademptae: genitive of definition, defining cladem ‘his
missortune, the loss of his sight ’.
