22 INTRODUCTION

though writhing in agony from the poisoned robe, is able in
a speech of thirty lines to enumerate all his achievementS, and
even to point out the fact that it is a strange foe by whom he
is conquered, against whom neither valour nor weapons ean
avail. The speeches of Ajax and Ulysses at the beginning of
Book xiii are, as we should expect, full of rhetoric, and
Seneca tells us that Ovid borrowed many of his ideas in this
scene from Μ. Porcius Latro, the rhetorician‚ who composed
a declamation ‘Armorum Iudicium' on this subject, and
mentions l. 121 as an instance, ‘arma viri sortis medios
mittantur in hostes‚' Latro's line being ‘mittamus arma in
hostes et petamus '. That sometimes the endeavour for effect
produces a result comic rather than pathetic is seen throughout
the speech of Narcissus, and again when Cadmus,¹ changing
into a serpent, beseeches Harmonia to touch him while there
is still anything left of him 3 Harmonia's dismay, too, upon
finding that what is happening rouses a far greater inclination
to laugh than to weep.

Repetition used for the sake of emphasis is also visible,
with frequently bad effects‚ e. ge where Ovid says in three
different ways that a wood throws its shade over the water,²
and where the gruesome result of flaying is expressed in three
lines and as many different ways.³

For the rest, instances os plays on words, conceits, paradoxes‚
antitheses, sententiae, abound throughout the poem, witness
the following (a) puns and conceits, cf. xiii. 550 ‘non oblita
animorum, annorum oblita suorum'3 iii. 425 ‘se cupit
imprudens, et qui probat, ipse probatur'3 v. 546 ‘ille sibi
ablatus fulvis amicitur ab alis'3 vi. 385 ‘quid me mihi
detrahis?' ς (b) paradox or oxymoron‚ cs. iii. 466 ‘inopem
me copia fecit'3 vii. 339 ‘ut quaeque pia est, hortatibus
