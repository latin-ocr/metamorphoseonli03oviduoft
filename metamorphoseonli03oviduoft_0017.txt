THE METAMORPHOSES ¹3

In the third book Ovid is at his best in the stories of Actaeon
and Pentheus, and in the episode os Acoetes. The story of
Narcissus and Echo, beautiful as parts os it are, is marred by
the fatal quibbling which Ovid cannot resist from putting on
the lips of the former as he soliloquizes over his love. But the
story of Cadmus and the founding of Thebes is strong and
stirring throughout. In other books may be mentioned the
stories of Phaethon, Ceres and Proserpina, Pygmalion, Ceyx
and Alcyone, but so many might be chosen for different charms
that it is difficult to select any specially.

Another of the most striking merits of the Asetamorplzoses is
the ingenuity Ovid shows in passing from one story to another,
and in the working out of the details of the transformations.
The ease with which he overcomes the difficulty of weaving
together such a multitude of tales with but the scantiest thread
is well-nigh miraculous. He shows signs but rarely of any
difficulty in introducing a story, and instead of being cumbered
with the number of legends at his command, repeatedly gives
evidence of still greater stores of knowledge unused, by
mentioning characters and stories only to pass them over.
The method of transition is manisold. Sometimes the order
is merely chronological, as, in this book, the various stories
tell the fates of the descendants of Cadmus. Again, arelation-
ship between a character of one story and that of another may
be the link, as, here, Cadmus is sent out to search for his
sister Europa, whose tale was told in the preceding book3 or
the hero or heroine of one story may tell a tale, as when Venus
tells Adonis the legend os Atalanta; the mention of a place
or an absent person may suggest a new story, or sometimes
a tale ending with a certain transformation may lead to another
containing one of the same kind.

In describing the actual transformations Ovid delights in
the appropriate change of the human features into those os
the animal or inanimate object in question. For instance in
