METAMORPHOSES 111. 141-152

both protasis and upodosis‚ expressing a vague future condition.
The future indicative is substituted for the subjunctive in the
apodosis, sor the sake os vividness. Cf. Tristia iv. 3. 78 ‘ Si
valeant homines, ars tua, Phoebe, iacet '. G.L. 596.

fortunae crimen, ‘a fault brought upon him by F ate’ ; fortunae
subjective genitive. Cf. Quintil. Inst. Or. vi ‘ Frustra mala omnia
ad Fortunae crirnen relegamus '.

These two lines cannot fail to remind us ofthe severallike them
which were written later by Ovid, aster his banishment, with
reference to his own fate, e. g. Tristia ii. 103, iii. 5. 49.

The public religion at Rome in Ovid's day had lost all meaning,
and become purely formal. Accordingly the poet, who was, and
knew himself to be, representative of his time in the fullest degree,
portrays gods and goddesses as swayed by all the most unworthy
passions os human bcings, in fact, as merely reflecting the manners
and morals os the sashionable society of his own day.

143. mons: Cithaeron.

eaede=sanguine, poetical. Cf. the similar use of φόνος in
Greek.

144. A variation of l. 50.
145. ex aequo, ‘equally.'

meta utraque, ‘from each end os his course.’ The metae
were the pillars which stood at each end of the stadium in the
Roman circus, to mark the turning-points and the goal of the race-

‘What time the Suri rode midway ’twixt the Poles.’—King.

Cf. Comus .-
‘And the slope sun his upward benni
Shoots against the dusky pole,
Pacing toward the other goal
Of his chamber in the east.'

147. participes operum: cf. 129 n.

Hyantius, Boeotian. Η yantes was an old name of the Boeo-

tians. Cf. Statius, S. ii. 7. init. ‘ Hyantiae sorores ’, of the Muses.
150. oum: conjunction‚ not preposition.

invecta ε cf. V. Aen. xii. 76 ‘ cum primum crastina caelo
Puniceis invecta rotis Aurora rubebit.'

Aurora was believed to ride in her chariot before the sun. Cf.
Tennyson, Tithonus.

152. idem : sc. spatium. Adverbial accusative of extent of space.
Cf. Hor. Odes iii. 19. 1 ‘ quantum distet ab Inacho Codrus ’.
utraque terra: the eastern and western regions.

[mem‚ repeated from l. 145, is Bentley's conjecture, while Merkel
reads creta with the same meaning ‘ goal ' as mela. Terra is given
by all known MSS. and by Planudes. The ancients were not so
sensitive as we are to the offence os tautology. Cs. 56 n.]
