THE second book ends with the story of how Jupiter, assuming
the form of a buil, beguiled Europa, daughter of the Phoenician
king Agenor, into leaving her companions on the seashore, and
mounting his back, whereupon he carried her over the sea to Crete.

[1—27. Jupiter has gained Crete ‘cuith his captive, and laid
aside lzis disguz·se‚ when Agenor sends his son Cadmus, under
penalty of exile, lo seek leis sister Europa. Faz'lz'ng in this, and
therefore not during to return, Cadmus consults tlze oracle (γ’ Apollo
concernt'ng his future home. In obedz’ence to tlze god’s command, on
leaving tlte cave he follows tlze heifer wlzz'clz lte meets and recogniees

1. deus: Jupiter. Cf. note above.
2. se confessus erat: sc. lovem.
Dictaea rura: Crete, from Dicte, a mountain in the east of
Crete.
Dr. Conway’s view (Proceedz'ngs qf the Class. Assoc. 1906,
p. 29) that the prominence given by Vergil in the opening os the
Sixth Aeneid to Crete and Cretan legends is due to the fact that
‘Vergil knew by tradition what we have only been willing to learn
from the sharp spades of Dr. Evans, that Crete was the earliest
home of European civilization ', might be stretched to explain how
it is that Cretan legend bulks so largely as it does, not only in
Vergil, but e. g. in Catullus and in Ovid.
3. pater: Agenor.
d iffnarue: i.e. that it was Jupiter who had carried off his
aug ter.

classica! construction. In classical prose it is only the passive
