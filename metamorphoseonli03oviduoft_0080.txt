METAMORPHOSES 111. 568-583

568. sie ego . . .: such a use of the first person by the poet is
strictly not in accordance with the rules of epic poetry‚ but the aim
is to give variety and vividness to the narrative.

eunti, ‘its course‚’ torrenti being understood.

571. ab obice :propter obicem, and is nearly equivalent to the
simple ablative of cause, but the preposition emphasizes the idea of
the starting-point or source of the action, ‘rushed on the more
furious from the bar! Cf. ab ictu, 183. Also i. 417 ‘vetus umor
ab igne Percaluit solis ⁹.

572. cruentati, ‘blood-stained,' from their struggle with the
worshippers.

573. negarunt: sc. se.

576. saera . . . secutum: Ovid nowhere says directly that
Bacchus had assumed the form of Acoetes, but it is implied in the
miracle wrought in his delivery, l. 699, just as in the story of the
sailors his real presence is not directly declared in words, but only
by the foliage and the animals sacred to the god. In Eur. Bacch. 434
sqq. Bacchus allows himself to be bound, and there also assumes
the character of one of his own followers. For this story cf.‚ as
well as the Homeric Hymn to Dionysus, Apollodor. iii. 5. 3 ; Seneca,
Oed. 4493 Propertius iii. 17. 253 Milton, Comus 48 sqq. Ovid
introduces the tale either for the sake of the transformation, or to
give still another waming to Pentheus by showing him the power
of the god he scorns. The description is vivid, but it is unlikely
that Pentheus' anger would have allowed him to listen to so long
a story. Ovid feels this, and makes Pentheus himself explain it,
l. 693, but the explanation he gives is unconvincing. It is more
in accordance with the poet's plan, however, to work in a vivid
story,fthan to make his characters act in strict conformity with
real li e.

Tyrrhena gente: ablative of origin. The Tyrrhenians were
a Pelasgic race who migrated from Lydia to Italy, and became
the ancestors of the Etrurians or Tuscans. Cf. 624 ‘ Tusca pulsus
ab urbe ’.

[This line is regarded as spurious by Heinsius and Burmann,
and Lemaire thinks rightly so, as the poet would not describe
Bacchus in this way.] But, as shown above, Euripides makes the
god declare himself in the form of one of his own followers, and
throughout the story his presence is suggested, not stated.

Quondam, codd. quendam Jahn.]

583. patria Maeonia est: Maeonia, a district of Lydia. All
the work of late years in excavation as well as at the comparative
study of language, tends to prove the truth of the ancient tradition
that the Etrurians came to Italy from Asia Minor. The tradition
is preserved in V. Aen. viii. 479—80 2

‘Vrbis Agyllinae sedes, ubi Lydia quondam
gens bello praeclara iu6gis insedit Etruscis.'
