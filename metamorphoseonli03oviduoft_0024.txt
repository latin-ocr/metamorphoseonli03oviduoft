20 INTRODUCTION

suggested and controlled by the master, or coloratae, invented
by the scholar and treated independently. The great fault lay
in the subjects chosen and the methods of treatment.
A striking situation was taken as subject, and developed‚ with
characters attached, instead of the study of a character and its
actions in certain situations. The subjects were generally sar-
fetched and unreal, e. g. gemini languentes, a fictitious case in
which two twins were ill, and it was necessary to sacrifice the
life of one to save the other. The father did so, and was
accused of murder by the mother. As a result of this method
the pupils, who were young and knew nothing of life, repre-
sented their characters as speaking and acting falsely. Then
when they were afterwards called upon as poets to represent
human life, they portrayed characters as they had invented
them or seen them invented by others in the schools, instead
of looking around them and describing what they saw. This
alone led to emptiness and unreality, and these evils were
increased by the continuous effort after emphasis and brilliancy.
As there was nothing new to be said, all labour was spent on
saying old things in a new way, and this characteristic—of
some point of view or moral maxim expressed in a strange
and, if possible, epigrammatic form—to which the Romans
gave the name sententia, is seen in all the Latin poetry that
dates from this time. Further, in order to keep the interest of
the audience—a difficul't matter for a subject with very little in
it to appeal to any one—speakers and writers indulged in such
devices as puns, conceits, antithesis, and paradox.

the pernicious influence of rhetoric. Also by his own great
