METAMORPHOSES III. 416-442

416. correptus, ‘ fascinated! This use of the word, referring to
the passions or emotions, is rare and poetical. Cf. V. Aen. xi. 584.
vellem haud correpta fuisset Militia tali ; also Met. ix. 734.

placed. Cf. ii. 719 “ spemque suam motis avidus circumvolitat alis ¹,
where spem = the entrails above which the kite is bovering.

eorpus = substance, umbra = shadow, a frequent antithesis.
[The better MSS. give quod unda csl.]

419. Pario: Paros, one of the Cyclades, was famous for its
white marble.

f420. humi positus, ‘lying on the ground’; positus middle.
C . n. 4 .

lumine declarari ’.

421. In Greek and Roman art both Apollo and Bacchus were
usually represented with long flowing hair. Cf. Met. iv. 17, 183 also

425-6. These two lines are an instance of Ovid’s habit of in-

much os his poetry‚ and throughout this speech, justly merits the
criticism of Dryden. Cf. Introduction on the flletamorplzoses.

427. irrita: to be taken adverbially ‘ vainly’.
