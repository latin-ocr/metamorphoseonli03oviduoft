THE INFLUENCE OF RHETORIC 19

Lucretius needed the help of rhetoric in the arrangement and
telling presentment of his arguments and the enlivenment of
his subject ; Catullus’s poetry contained the eloquence of early
times when it was still the natural expression of thought.
Vergil’s style was essentially artificial, and derived much effect
from striking and unusual arrangement of words, but his genius
was too great to allow him to sink into the empty brilliance
and artificiality os later poets. He availed himself of rhetorical
devices to give force and colour to his pictures‚ but avoided
the defects‚ which at that time had gained no hold upon
' oratory. His rhetorical power is seen most clearly in the
council of the gods in Book X of the Aenec'd, in the speeches
of Venus and Juno, and also in the speeches of Drances and
Turnus in the council of the Latins in Book XI. Horace,
though showing glimpses of rhetorical glitter in the Odes, yet
escaped any evil influence, and drove his points home by the
aid of his own curiosa felicitas rather than by any strained
or unnatural order of words and ideas.

With the accession of Augustus, however, the equal rule
of poetry and oratory‚ with rhetoric serving both faithfully, ends.
Under the Emperors public speaking lost its practical object
of serving the public good (there was no need to influenee the
feelings of the people in favour of a course of action already
inevitable by the will of the Emperor) and degenerated into
rhetoric. It was no longer a man's object to say something in
the best possible manner in order to win the consent of his
listeners‚ but to make the obvious remarks in as brilliant
a style as possible. Rhetoric became therefore the master
instead of the servant 3 the schools of rhetoric became schools
of declamation‚ and this change was bound to react upon the
work of the poets trained in the schools. There were two
classes of declamationes—suason'ae, dealing with abstract or
philosophie subjeets‚ and controversiae, dealing usually with

some judicial point or case. They were also either tractatae,
