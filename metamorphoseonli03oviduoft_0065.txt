METAMORPHOSES ΙΙΙ. 169-186

169. Ismenis: Theban‚from Ismenus, a rix-er os Boeotia, near
Thebes.

170. erat: the usual prose construction with quamvis is the
subjunctive. The indicative was first used in poetry by Lucretius,
and after him the usage grew till it was used as frequently as the
subjunctive by the post-Augustam poets. G.L. 606.

solutis : sc. capillis. Ablative of description.

172. urnis : to be taken with both verbs, excipiunt and fundunt.

173. solita: passive ‘wonted ’. Not found in this sense in
Cicero or Caesar, but common later. Cf. Tac. Hist. iv. 60 ‘ cunc-
tantibus solita insolitaque alimenta deerant '. Cf. also l. 242.

Titania: Diana, 'as the sister of Sol, the Sun-god, son of
Hyperion, and grandson os Titan.

174. nepos Cadmi: Actaeon.

175. non certis = incertis. (Cf. V. Aen. ii. 724 ‘sequiturque
patrem non passibus aequis'.) ‘With idle steps‚’ i. e. with no
definite object before thern.

177. qui simul = simul alque is.

178. sicut erant, ‘just as they were.' This poetical use of
sicut with the verb ‘to be’ is analogous to ὡς εἶχον in Greek, to
denote an unchanged condition of the subject in a new state of
action.

180. circumfusae: cf. 43 n.

183. qm· color = is color qui.

adversi solis, ‘ the fronting sun‚’ King.

ab ictu: for ab instead of the simple ablative of instrument
cf. i. 66 ‘pluvioque madescit ab austro! The ablative is regarded
as local, expressing the point from which the colour comeS, rather
than as instrumental.

184. nubibus: possessive dative.

In this line notice (1) the lengthening of -et in solet, by stress
in the third foot, (2) hiatus in the fifth soot, (3) spondee in the
fifth foot. Where the fifth foot of the hexameter is a spondee, the
fourth foot is almost invariably a dactyl. XVe find only one excep·
tion to this rule in the Aletamm. (i. 117); three in Vergil (Georg.
iii. 276, Aen. iii. 74, vii. 634) ; three in Catullus ; ‘ one in Lucretius
and only five even in Ennius' (Plessis‚ Mdtrique Gr. et Lat. ξ 70).
See L. Miiller, p. 145.

(1) appears to be an archaism, frequent in Vergil.

(2) and (3) are both imitations of Greek rhythm‚ and are
usually found in Latin with Greek words. Cf. ii. 247.

185. is, ‘ such,‘ to be taken with color, 183.

sine veste: adjectival. Cf. 62 n.

186. turba stipata suarum: the simple ablative without a pre-
position is strange, as it is difficult to see how the instrumental
meaning can be made to preponderate here. Cf. Cic. Pro Sest.
4495 ‘qui stipatus semper sicariis . . . fuit ’. Cf. 115 n. ; i. 747, and

vii. 50 ‘Matrum celebrabere turlga ’.
