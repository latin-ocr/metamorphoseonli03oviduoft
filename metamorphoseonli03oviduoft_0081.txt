METAMORPHOSES 111. 584—597

584. Order-non milti arva quae duri iuvenci colerent pater . . .
reliquit. colerent, final.

Acoetes mentions the three ways by which a man might earn
his living in old times, farming, pasturing flocks and benis, or
fishing. Os these three the fisherman's trade was least profitable.

587. pisces: with both decipere and ducere.

588. ars illi sua census erat, ‘his craft was his wealth.’ The
property of a Roman was entered in the census or register, and
hence the word carne to be used of the property registered.

sua refers to the logical subject of the sentence (contained in
illi) as is common when the sentence can be so turned as to make
the grammatical and logical subject identical. Cf. Cic. Pro Sesl.
i. 42 ‘ hunc sui cives e civitate eiecerunt '.

traderet: subjunctive with the circumstantia! use of cum, the
imperfect expressing contemporaneous action. Cf. G.L. 585.

589: studii, ‘callingl successor et heres, used ironically as if
speaking of a great inheritance.

591. paternum, ‘ inheritance) paternus is used of the property
or externa] relations of a father, whilst patrius is used of internal
characteristics or relations 3 hence paterni agri, but patrius amor.

593. addidici, ‘ Ι learnt besides ’-in addition to fishing.

594. Oleniae sidus pluviale Capellae: Olenos was a town in
Achaea. Olenia Capella = the goat (Amalthea) which suckled the
infant Zeus, called Olenia either because, according to one legend,
it was born near Olenos, or because, according to another, Amalthea,
the nymph to whom it belonged, was the daughter of Olenos. The
goat was afterwards as a reward changed into a star in the constel-
lation of Auriga, which rose in the rainy season.

595. Τᾶῖνὲὂῡεῐιτ one of the Pleiades. Hyades, a group of seven
stars in the head of Taurus, which brought rain both at their
rising and setting.

Arcton: the double constellation of the Great and the Little
Bear. ⁴

597. Chiae telluris: it is a moot point whether this refers to
the island of Chios or of Ceos. The former is a large island close
to the coast of Ionia, the latter a small one in the Cyclades, near
the coast of Attica. Acoetes does not say from what port they had
started, but only that they were making sor Delos, and that on
leaving this island os Chios or Ceos, Naxos was on their right.
The objection to Chios is that if—-as it would seem most natural
to suppose—the sailors had started from Lydia, their horne, Naxos
would not be on their right when they set out sor Delos, but on
their left. Therefore some of the commentators think it better to
take the island as Ceos [and read Ciae telluris} Pliny, Nat. Hist.
iv. 12-20 says that Ceos was called ὑδρόεσσα,- ‘well-watered‚' by
the Greeks, which would agree with the latices inferre (601) of
Ovid. On the other hand, Ceos from Asia would be out of the
way to Delos. Moreover, Chios was famous for its wine, and had
