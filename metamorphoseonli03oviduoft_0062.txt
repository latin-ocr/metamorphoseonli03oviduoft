METAMORPHOSES III. 131-141

[131—137. Thebes is now established ‹mdprospm-ous, ancl Cadmus
seems blessed in his marriage and descendants. But no mon can
be called happy before the end os lzz's lise]

131. stare is often used forflorere and is best taken so here. Cf.
V. Georg. iv. 209 ‘ Stat fortuna domus ’. .
132, soceri, ‘ parents-in-laW,’ applied to the wife’s mother as well

as to her father. Cf. V. Aen. ii. 457. Cadmus married Harmonia,
the daughter of Mars and Venus.

133. genus, ‘posterity.'
134. natos: only one son is told of by other writers, i. e. Poly-
dorus, who succeeded Cadmus as ruler.

natas : four, Autonoe, Ino, Semele, Agave.

pignora, lit. ‘ pledges,' hence regularly used of children regarded
as pledges of affection. Sometimes the word is used of other
relations, and here is applied not to children, but grandchildren.

135. scilieet: not ironical, but used to introduce a maxim.

A reminiscence of the story told in Herodotus (i. 32) of Solon’s
conversation with Croesus, concerning true happiness. The phrase
σκοπεῖν τὸ τέλος passed into a proverb. Cf. Eur. Troades 510 τῶν
δ’ εὐδαιμόνων Μηδένα νομίζετ’ εἰτυχεῖν, πρὶν ἂν θάνῃ.

136. que . . . nemo z poetical for nec . . . quisquam.

[138—252. Actaeon, son os Autonoe, and grandson of Cadmus,
when hnntlng willa his comrades, ot noon calls on them to rest
till the marrow. Then, strayz’ng away from them z'n search of
a resting-place, he comes unawares upon Diona bothz'ng z‘n the
midst of her nymphs. The goddess, in her anger at being thus
seen by mczn’s eyes, sprinkles him with water and changes him
into a stag. In this form he is pnrsned ond torn to pieces by hz's
own honnds, urged on by the comrades with whom he has hunted
so (sten, and who, even at the moment of his death, miss his
presence among them ond call loudly for him.] The story is beauti-

fully retold by Mr. Noyes in his poem Actaeon, published in
Blackwood's Affagazine, April, 1909.

138. nepos: Actaeon.

139. aliena, ‘ strange, foreign to his nature.’

140. vosque canes: such a turning aside from the original
object of address to apostrophize some other person or thing, is
a common device of the poets for sustaining the liveliness of the
Story.

sanguine : ablative after a participle expressing fullness; really
ablative of instrument.

141. at here introduces a remonstrance. Though Actaeon was
the first cause of grief to Cadmus, he was so unwittingly, through
a missortune‚ not a fault.

si quaeras . . . invenies: irregular sequence in a conditional
sentence. The regular construction would be present subjunctive in
