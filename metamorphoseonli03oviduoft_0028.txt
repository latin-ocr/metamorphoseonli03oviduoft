24 INTRODUCTION

blemishes. He shows Ovid's failing of not knowing where to
stop, and often becomes wearisome through multiplicity of
detail. Quintilian ¹ calls him a model sor orators rather than
for poetS, ‘Lucanus ardens et concitatus et sententiis clarissi-
mus, et, ut dicam quod sentio, magis oratoribus quam poetis
imitandus.' His rhetoric is perhaps at its best in the speech
of Cato when he refuses to consult the oracle of Ammon, but
it is more osten at its worst, as in the description of the battle
at the end of Book iii, with its unnecessary details, forced
expressions, and false sentiment, e. g. the death of the father,
who, to join his son, killed in the fight, first stabs himself, and
then leaps into the sea. Book vii is full of rhetoric, especially
in the respective harangues of Caesar and Pompey to their
soldiers, with the rhetorical climax of the latter :

‘ . . curn prole et coniuge supplex,
imperii salva si maiestate liceret,
volveret ante pedes.’

Even more of a slave to rhetorIC than Lucan was Seneca,
the poet and philosopher, who was trained in rhetoric by his
father, and himself became a brilliant pleader. His qualities
were akin to those of Ovid, whom he admired and followed
closely. He had Ovid's ingenuity, wit, and readiness of epigram,
but he had also his habit of tedious repetition and fondness for
forced conceits, without the same redeeming genius for descrip-
tive narrative. The influenee of rhetoric is clearly seen in his
tragedies, which are full of declamation and exaggeration, and
altogether devoid of vitality. His characters have no life, but
are mere marionettes‚ into whose mouths he puts rhetorical
harangues and detailed descriptions. They are not living
men and women, but the stock characters of the schools. It
is only necessary to compare his tragedies with their Greek
originals to see how far removed they are from the facts of life
