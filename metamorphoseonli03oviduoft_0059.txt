For the fulfilment os the prophecy, cf. iv. 563, which relates how
Cadmus prayed that if the wrath of the gods was still pursuing him
on account of the slaying ofthe dragon, he might himself be changed
into a serpent. His prayer was granted at once3 his wife Harmonia
was also transformed into a serpent, and they fled together into
the forest. Cf. the song of the boy Callicles in Matthew Arnold' s
Empedocles on Eum, m which he tells the story of the

‘two bright and aged snakes,
Who once were Cadmus and Harmonia. . . .
There those two live, far in the lllyrian brakes!
They had stay’d long enough to see,
In Thebes, the billow of calamity
Over their own dear children roll’‚d
Curse upon curse, pang upon pang,
For years, they sitting helpless in their home,
A grey old man and woman; yet of old
The gods had to their marriage corne
And at the banquet all the Muses sang’.

The student should read and compare the whole song with
the story as told by Ovid.
